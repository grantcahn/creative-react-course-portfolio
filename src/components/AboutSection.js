          <p>
            What started as a hobby turned into a passion. I have been creating
            websites for the past 6 years. I have worked with various clients
            and have helped them to improve their online presence. I can help
            you to create a professional website for your business.

            I started with good old HTML and CSS, WordPress and then moved on to
            using React, Next.js and Svelte. Styling disciplines such as I have
            mainly been responsible for the front-end development of websites. I
            have also worked with back-end technologies like Nodejs and MongoDB.
